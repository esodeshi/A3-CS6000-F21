Base Repo for CS6000  F2021 Git assignment.

## Collaborating

Dear CS6000 F2021 Classmates,

Since we're all having to edit the same document, I thought it'd be nice to provide some tips and perhaps make some agreements about how we should behave in this repo.
If you disagree with anything I say here, please say so and explain why.

1. Do not include the preamble, `\begin{document}`, and `\end{document}` in your personal tex file.
This breaks building the whole file.
2. One sentence, one line.
This is a suggestion Dr. Boult gives in a video, and I've carried it to work with great success.
3. Your personal tex file should be a `\subsection`, and subsections of that should be marked with `\subsubsection`.
This is based on the main tex file having two sections.

Sincerely,
Will
